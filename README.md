# Cross-Modal-Representation-Learning-using-DropDTWPytorch
cross-modal representation learning and the different techniques we used to explore the same. We explore image-text cross modal representation using linear techniques like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and it's non linear variant Deep CCA with different kinds of losses - Mean Squared Loss and Triplet Loss. We then move onto to the main theme of our project, learning video-text representations and doing so using a proxy task of alignment using Drop-Dynamic Time Warping (Drop-DTW) on an instructional video dataset
